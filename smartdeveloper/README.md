# Smart Template Processor

Not functional extension at this time.

Smart Template Processor extension helps you code faster by using the power of Ajuro Template Processor (AJP) directly from your IDE.
While the WEB version of AJP can not apply the code into files, this extension has this advantage.
Good templates can increase your productivity, saving the time you usualy spend on writing support code.
